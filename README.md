# Visualizing Neuroevolution in Neural Network Learning

Bachelor's Thesis.

This thesis examines options for neural network learning achieved by means of neuroevolution, 
examines general functioning of neuroevolution, design and implementation of neuroevolution 
and marginally deals with design and implementation of feed-forward neural networks with fully connected layers. 
The goal of this thesis is to introduce program, that executes neuroevolutionary algorithm and separate graphic 
application, which encapsulates this program for easier use and for display of graphic output of the program 
visualizing problem-solving capabilities of neural networks created by neuroevolution. 
The end part of the thesis is devoted to experiments done on the created program.
